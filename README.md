📣 Welcome Contributors — Let’s Build the Future of Technical Recruiting Together

This project is building a next-generation AI-assisted recruiting platform — built in public, open-source, and shaped by real engineers from day one.

If you're here, it means you’re someone I want to collaborate with.
You’re not “free labor.”
You're a partner in the foundation of something big.

And in return, I’m offering something most open-source repos don’t:

🌟 What You Gain by Contributing
1. Visibility to Companies Actively Hiring

I work directly with teams who are constantly looking for strong engineers.
By contributing here, you’re building a public portfolio that hiring managers actually see.

2. A Warm Introduction When You're Ready

Top contributors aren’t just names on GitHub. I personally get to know your strengths, your code style, and your interests. When you’re looking for your next role, I can put your background and work directly in front of decision-makers.

3. Interview Coaching & Insider Advice

I’ve spent years on the hiring side.
I know what teams look for, what signals matter, and what separates top candidates.
Contributors get tips, prep, and specific feedback so you’re not going into interviews “cold.”

4. Real-world, production-grade experience

This project isn’t “hello world.”
We’re building:

- FastAPI backend
- Streamlit UI
- AI-driven matching engine
- Job & candidate processing pipelines
- Agent-like chat system
- Real customers in sight
- Running it all in AWS in production

Your contributions will sharpen your engineering skills and give you something meaningful to showcase.

🚀 What We’re Building

A full recruiting platform that supports:

- Creating jobs from prompts or uploaded job descriptions
- Parsing resumes into structured profiles
- Matching candidates ↔ jobs with explainable scoring
- Multi-step recruiter agent chat
- Clean REST API + Streamlit UI
- Modern modular architecture
- OpenAI-enhanced flows (optional)

It’s a real SaaS, developed openly with contributors like you.

🤝 How to Get Involved
1. Star and Fork the Repo

It helps visibility and keeps you in the loop.

2. Send me your resume on LinkedIn

Since the platform isn't live yet send me your resume and we can chat to see what you can help with that isn't already a github issue created in the platform to-do. If you find a github issue you can work on please feel free to pick it up.


🧪 Current Tech Stack (to evolove from here)

Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
Frontend: Streamlit
Database: SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (prod)
AI: OpenAI embeddings, structured extraction
Infra: Docker, App Runner / ECS / K8s (future)

If you're a Python engineer, ML engineer, UI builder, DevOps person, or just curious—you're welcome.

🗺 Roadmap Snapshot

- Matching 2.0
- Candidate Pools
- Interview assistance
- Outreach generation
- ATS integrations
- Plugins + extensibility
- Public API

There’s a lot to do—and a lot of room for contributors to influence direction.

💬 When its interview time.

I will help you as a mentor for your role.

✨ Final Note

This repo is more than code. 
It’s a community of engineers building something meaningful—together.

And if you put in good work here, I will go out of my way to:

- introduce you to hiring teams
- advocate for you
- coach you through interviews
- help you win roles that match your capabilities

Join in. Be visible. Build something real.
Let’s create opportunities—for you, and for the people we’ll help hire.

Welcome to the project.
Let’s make something amazing.
